### Initial Game Structure Design

Created the GamePlay class to represent the core game logic.

Declared attributes for player hands and decks.

Implemented methods for adding cards, shuffling decks, and displaying game information.

Integrated Python libraries such as Tkinter for UI elements and PIL for image processing.

### Card Interaction Features

Added the ability for users to view card images on the screen.

Implemented drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to move cards.

Enabled various mouse interactions, including right-click to display card details and double-click to flip a card.

### Deck Cards Implementation

Introduced cards with a back image that can be flipped to reveal the front image.

Managed image references efficiently to prevent cards from disappearing due to garbage collection.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

Fixed an issue where cards were not displaying correctly by ensuring consistent image reference handling.

Improved the responsiveness of card dragging, ensuring cards could be freely moved even after snapping to a predefined position.

### Snapping Functionality

Implemented snapping functionality so that dragged cards snap to a target area if they are close enough.

Addressed initial issues with cards getting locked, making the snapping behavior more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Current Focus

Optimizing the GamePlay class for better time efficiency and performance.

Fine-tuning the user interface to improve the user experience.

Preparing a complete game prototype by addressing remaining performance and interaction issues.












##################### TO DO ##################### 

re-arrange all helper function: put functions in correct named class

when drag card overlap the 2 spot, it will lock into the last drawed. write a function that determin which spot overlap the most area and lock into it.

may need re-structure a lot of functions especially action functions.

develop action one card overlap another one to determin if it should be attack it.

keep thinking about the structure of game, how to deal with seperating 2 players cards.
